# Introduction
TPPSc is a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) module built to extend the functionality of the [Tripal](http://tripal.info/) toolset. The purpose of this tripal module is to permit internal curation of manuscripts available on public sites with supplemental data, such as Dryad. This module will allow members of the database team to load existing flat files and select the data that is relevant. This module does not currently require any other modules.
